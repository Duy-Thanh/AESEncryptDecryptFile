# Software development history and timeline

- Software development history

The software was first created in 2018 by Duy Thanh (@ Duy-Thanh). However, development was suspended due to private life problems. A year later, the project was restarted and development continued until 2020, when it was released to the public via a small YouTube video demo. This video is still active today, you can watch it here:

This project was closed source initially, however, with the growing community and the needs of its users over time, I found myself underpowered (of course I would still join as a developer. for this application now and in the future, and certainly so), so I decided to open this repository with the intention of hoping the community contribute to this project further in the future.

This project, and this repository still, will, has been, and is being maintained by me. All contributions from the community are warmly welcomed and welcomed.
